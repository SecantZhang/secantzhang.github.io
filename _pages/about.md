I am a senior undergraduate student (graduated on Dec 19, 2020) studying computational statistics and data sciences at the Pennsylvania State University. I'm currently advised by [Dr. Ting Wang](https://www.alpslab.ai/) for conducting researches in security and privacy of machine/deep learning based systems. Previously, I worked as a bioinformatics programmer at [the Mahony Lab](http://mahonylab.org/) where I had pleasure working with a group of genius researchers from May till Dec, 2019.  

My research focus on deep learning security & privacy, more specifically the backdoor attack and defense in deep learning based systems. My other interests are social computing, differential privacy as well as its applications.
