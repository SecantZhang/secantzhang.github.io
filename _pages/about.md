ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm a ~~1st~~ 2nd year computer science PhD student at [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/) working with [Dr. Jennie Rogers](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jennie/). I have a broad interest in the area of system security and privacy. More concretely, Iâ€™ve been working on improving the security and privacy guarantees of database management systems with cryptography protocols such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs. Iâ€™m also interested in adversarial and backdoor attacks of deep learning models/systems.

<!-- My research focus on deep learning security & privacy, more specifically the backdoor attack and defense in deep learning based systems. My other interests are social computing, differential privacy as well as its applications.  -->
I completed my B.S. in computational statistics and data sciences at [the Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) from 2016 to 2020. During my undergraduate studies, I was advised by [Dr. Ting Wang](https://alps-lab.github.io/) for doing researches in security and privacy of deep learning based systems. Previously, I worked as a bioinformatics programmer at [the Mahony Lab](http://mahonylab.org/) where I had pleasure working with a group of genius researchers from May till Dec, 2019.  

### News:
